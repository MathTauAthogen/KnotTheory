Just a little repo for my PRIMES-USA 2020 project.

I'm doing knot theory research under Dr. Yakov Kononov.

TODO:

- Implement quick inverse algorithm that takes the inverse of the R-matrices to create the inverse r-matrices.

- Compute all of the cabled polynomials

- Port to Sage

- Find better way to represent polynomials

- Generate second research report
